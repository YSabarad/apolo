# Project Apolo
A resource pack for Disney Infinity 3.0 on PC. A community-driven, open-source project to keep the game alive.

# Why does this project exist?
To create the ultimate version of Disney Infinity. When the game was abruptly shut down in early 2017, Disney did us the favor of providing us with PC ports. Named the Gold Editions, these ports for all 3 iterations of the game promised the full experience without the hassle of toys-to-life. No figures to buy, no portal to connect - but upon release, it became apparent that there were a few downsides to these games as well. 

The 3.0 version was missing content! There was a wave of figures, playsets, and toys that were released physically in early 2016 that didn't make the cut to the PC versions of the game. This includes a Marvel release cenetered around the movie Civil War, a relase inspired by the movie Finding Dory, and a few other iconic Disney characters. This left a sour taste in the mouth of a lot of the community, because they found out that these Gold editions were more of a silver. So the community banded together and after a few years of work, Apolo was born!

# What does it do?
For starters, it finishes what the developers didn't. We have added all the released characters, and playsets and toys are to come. From the Marvel Battlegrounds playset, this includes Black Panther, Vision, Ant-Man, and the Civil War version of Captain America. Black Suit Spider-Man, Ultron, and the Hulkbuster were already included.

There was also a release of Disney characters that were missing. This included Baloo, Mad Hatter, Alice, Time, Nemo, and Dory. They have all been put in!

And Apolo's biggest surprise was extra characters! Our community's sluething found not 1, not 2, but 6 characters that were nearly complete but never released to the public! After a lot of hard work, we've put them all in too! This includes Spider-Gwen, Doctor Strange, Clu, Peter Pan, Maui, and Moana!

# How do I get started?
First thing's first, make sure that you have a legally aquired copy of the game. The community here at Apolo wants to ensure that support gets to the developers of the game that we love so much! The game is available on Steam for $30, but we recommend getting the Gold Collection which includes 1.0, 2.0, and 3.0! Once you've gotten your game, take a look here to start your Apolo install:
